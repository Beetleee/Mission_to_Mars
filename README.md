# Module 10: Mission to Mars

### by Terra Lasho

## Project Overview

I am tasked to analyze some new information for a Client who wants to incorporate it into a web page. For this, I will be using BeautifulSoup and Splinter web tools to scrape the data on a Mongo database in order to display it, and alter the Client’s website to incorporate it with the data.

## Results

### Deliverable #1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
#### 1) Full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image

## Summary
Overall, this analysis resulted in the updated incorporation of several images of Mars’s hemispheres into the webpage. The webpage is mobile responsive and can be updated upon clicking.  This project was a great way to use interfacing applications to read, extract, transfer, and incorporate information via coding.
